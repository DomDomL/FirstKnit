# A Little Survey

Here are just a few questions so I can get to know you and so you can get practice submitting an assignment in Canvas.  For each question, insert your answer underneath. Make sure each answer is at the minimum a complete sentence with correctly spelled words and correct puncuation. 

## A short history of you.  
Where did you attend High School, and did you graduate? Compare english class to math, is one easier for you than the other? Finally which subject did you do the best in? Your answer should have at least two sentences devoted to each question.  
  
### my answer     
  I went to Little rock highschool for one year. polytechnic high school for my first three years. I love math and history. My favorite thing about math is that it is easier to understand then anything else for me. My overall best subject is math. My other favorite subject is history as I enjoy to know what has happen but enjoy more doing my own research where i get to see the darker past.
